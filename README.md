SMART LOGISTICS FOR QUALITY FOOD DURING PANDEMIC CRISIS

The conventional method of checking the safety and freshness of goods (fruits and vegetables) is done manually by a person during the loading and unloading process. In this real-time monitoring system, the goods are monitored using sensors. Temperature, photoresistor and ultrasonic sensors are used to gather information about the freshness of the product.  The NodeMCU module in the model sends data given by the sensors to the cloud and then sends alerts to a phone/computer for remote monitoring in transit. This system can keep check the goods from being damaged or rotten during transportation. There were several instances in which, stale food was delivered to the restaurants and several people got infected. This system could be monitored by the health department to avoid decayed food consumption by the consumers.
